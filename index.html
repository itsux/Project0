  <h2><u>Notes on <em>The Basics of the Web and HTML</em></u></h2>

  <h3>The Basics of the Web</h3>
  <p>The web is made up of Billions of HTML <em>(<u>H</u>yper<u>T</u>ext <u>M</u>arkup <u>L</u>anguage)</em> documents connected through <em>Hyperlinks</em>. The content on the Internet is stored on servers that can be accessed through a web browser.</p>

  <p>A web browser <em>(Firefox, Chrome, Safari)</em> communicate with servers through <b>HTTP</b> protocol by entering a <b>URL</b>. The server will in turn rerspond with a <b>HTML</b> document which the browser interprets and displays.

  <h3>HTML</h3>

  <p>HTML is the <em>language</em> used to visualise the content of the web by a common standard. A HTML document is made up of: <b>Text content</b> <em>(What you see)</em>, <b>Markup</b> <em>(What it looks like)</em>, <b>References to other documents</b> <em>(e.g. images and videos)</em> and <b>Links to other pages</b> <em>(Hyperlinks)</em>.

  <h4><u>Tags and Elements</u></h4>

  <p>HTML code consists of <b>elements</b> containing <b>tags</b>. There's an <em>opening</em> and <em>closing</em> tag. The structure looks like this:</p>

  <p><b><FONT COLOR="blue"> &ltname&gt</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">content</FONT><FONT COLOR="blue">&lt/name&gt</FONT></b></p>

    <p>This constitues an element where <b><FONT COLOR="blue"> &ltname&gt</font></b> is the <em>opening tag</em> and <b><FONT COLOR="blue"> &lt/name&gt</font></b> is the <em>closing tag</em>. <b>Void tags</b> are the exception as they do not require a <em>closing tag</em>. An example of this is the <b>&ltbr&gt</b> tag.</p>

  <h4><u>Attributes</u></h4>

      <p>Tags can also contain <b>Attributes</b> which, for example, can create a link to a differnet webpage. The <em>Anchore</em> tag is an example of this: <b>&lta href="www.udacity.com"&gt</b> -where <em>href</em> is the <em>Attribute</em>.</p>

  <h4><u>Inline vs Block Elements</u></h4>

  <p>HTML elements are divided in two differnet categories: <b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b>. Inline elements are, as the name suggests; in line, and Block elements have an "invisible box" around them.</p>

  <h3>How computers interprets code</h3>

  <p>When code, such as HTML, is rendered by a web browser it's done so literally. In other words; the computer is not applying any creativity when it "reads" code to fill in blanks or correct for errors <em>(as a human might do)</em>. It also means that it will do <u>exactly</u> what the code tells it to do.</p>
